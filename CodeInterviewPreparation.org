* How to do code interview (40 minutes, 2 questions)
** Understand the question, take time come up with strategy
*** TODO Identify various strategy by going through leetcode and github
** Come up with a solution, don't worry about optimization in the beginning
** Tell interviewer about your assumption
*** ask if any information is missing
*** Like array sorted or not
*** Explain your understanding and if anything need to be corrected
*** Write down your understanding in coderpad
*** Focus on the constraints which might reveal the steps
**** TODO Decision points, how that reduces the input 
** Datastructure to use
*** Array, Matrix, HashMap
*** TODO Datastructures and its properties
**** Insert, update and select Big O
** Iterative solution or recursive solution
*** If iterative solution, how many loops, variable names etc,
** If recursive solution
*** Base Case
*** Exit case
*** How to move the base case
** TODO Other types of problem solving (priority queues, heaps)
** Write pseudo code
*** Function, variables etc
*** Walk through the steps to show how code works
*** How code works for various inputs
*** Include edge cases
*** Show state for each steps
** Explain time complexity and space complexity
*** TODO For various data structures
** Ask interviewer if you need adjust the solution to improve the complexity
** Write code - use JavaScript
* How i am going to prepare
** Read crack code interview book (just coding section)
** Focus on critical requirements (don't worry about dynamic programming)
** Finish all the easy questions in leetcode
** Practise should follow the interview style, all the steps, no direct writing of code
** Get paid account for a month and practice fb questions in leetcode
